📁 Project Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end SQL-based analysis on a simulated dataset of student scores across different classes. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in advanced SQL concepts and analytical thinking — skills crucial for any Data Analyst role.

✅ Objectives
1. Create and manage a relational database using MySQL.
2. Write optimized SQL queries to extract insights.
3. Apply Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Aggregate Functions.
4. Segment and rank students based on their performance.
5. Prepare queries that are ready to be used in Python or for dashboarding tools.

🧮 Dataset
- 20 students from Classes A, B, and C.
Each student has:
- student_id
- name
- class
- score

🔍 Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
1. RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()
2. NTILE() for quartile segmentation
3. CASE WHEN logic for score banding
4. WITH (CTEs) for clean and modular queries
5. JOIN with derived tables and CTEs
6. Aggregate Functions: AVG(), COUNT(), etc.
7. Analytical comparisons: class average vs individual score

📌 Analysis Tasks Performed
1. Class-wise Average Score
2. Top Scorer per Class
3. Students Scoring Below Class Average
4. Score Banding into Quartiles (Top 25%, etc.)
5. Honors List: Top 25% scorers above class average
6. Class-wise Top 3 Rankings Summary
7. Score Gap between highest and lowest scorer in each class

💡 Why This Project?
I built this project to:
1. Practice advanced SQL queries in a real-world scenario
2. Build a portfolio-ready SQL project to share with recruiters
3. Prepare for Data Analyst interviews with practical query challenges

📂 How to Use
1. Download the .sql file.
2. Import it into MySQL Workbench or any SQL engine.
3. Run the script to create database, insert data, and execute analysis.
